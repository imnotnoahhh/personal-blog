# Abstract

This research proposes a lightweight attention mechanism that reduces computational cost by 40% while maintaining 98% of the original model's accuracy on standard benchmarks.

## Methodology

We utilized a sparse attention matrix...

## Results

| Model | Accuracy | Latency (ms) |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| BERT  | 89.2%    | 120          |
| Ours  | 88.9%    | **72**       |
