It is 00:43 on January 1st, 2026.

As the clock ticks over, marking a fresh start, I find myself sitting with the echoes of the past year. 2025 was a busy year—I did a lot of things. But looking back, it feels like a landscape of mixed results. There were failures, there were successes, but truthfully, the failures outweighed the rest. And even the things I consider "successes" weren't exactly outstanding.

Why was that? I’ve spent tonight analyzing where I fell short, and it comes down to three main reasons.

First, **laziness**. I realized I am often what they call a "night thinker, day sleeper." I have endless ideas when lying in bed at night, but when the sun comes up, I lack the discipline to put them into practice. I had the vision, but not the execution.

Second, **lack of planning and motivation**. I moved without a clear map. Without a definitive goal to aim for, my efforts were scattered. I need to find that target that gives me a reason to push forward.

Third, **impatience**. I tried to take steps that were too big, trying to "swallow an elephant whole." I wanted instant results and tried to do everything at once, rather than trusting the process of taking it one step at a time.

So, my outlook for 2026 is simple but critical: I want to fix these problems.

This year is about bridging the gap between thought and action. It is about creating concrete plans and finding my "why." And most importantly, it is about patience—taking steady, consistent steps rather than trying to leap across the chasm in one go.

Here's to a 2026 where problems are solved, and real results are achieved. Happy New Year.
