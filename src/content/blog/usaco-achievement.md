On January 10, 2026 (Beijing Time), I participated in the USACO (USA Computing Olympiad) competition.

It was an intense journey, but I managed to advance from the Bronze division all the way to Platinum in a single contest window. This achievement marks a significant milestone in my competitive programming journey.
