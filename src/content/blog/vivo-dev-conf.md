On October 10, 2025, I stepped out of the classroom and into the **Vivo Developer Conference (VDC)**. It was my first time attending a major industry event not as a student spectator, but as an active iOS developer.

While the "BlueLM" (Vivo's on-device Large Language Model) was technically impressive—showcasing how AI moves from cloud to edge—what truly moved me was something else entirely.

## Technology's Ultimate Goal

The highlight for me was the focus on **Humanistic Care**. As one speaker put it: *"The ultimate goal of technology is to let people feel happiness and arrive at beauty."*

When the light of technology shines in, the needs of hidden groups are finally seen.

### "Heard" and "Seen"

Vivo introduced two feature matrices that bridge the gap for the hearing and visually impaired:

*   **vivo Heard**: For hearing-impaired users, the phone can now separate speakers in a chaotic multi-person conversation and identify key environmental sounds (like a doorbell or kettle) through vibration alerts.
*   **vivo Seen**: Using "Smart Memory" and "Environment Q&A," the phone becomes an eye. It describes the environment—friends' faces, surroundings—in text/voice, helping visually impaired users explore the world with dignity.

## My Takeaway

Seeing these features live made me realize that engineering isn't just about optimization or logic; it's about **empathy**. Code can be a bridge.

Leaving the conference, I felt more motivated than ever to push the boundaries of what a high schooler can create.
